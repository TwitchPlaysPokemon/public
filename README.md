# Issues (Bug Reporting & Feature Requests)

Issues include bugs and features requests. [Click here to see all open issues.](https://github.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/public/issues) 
 
To report bugs or request features, simply post in [public-dev](https://discordapp.com/invite/5HrkPR7). If necessary, a developer will open a new issue or update existing issue.

Bug reports should as specific as possible. If relevant, please try to include:
- a link to chatlogs
- a link to a Twitch clip/video
- literal quotes from both yourself and `tpp` bot, if whisper messages were involved

You may also open and comment on issues directly. Please take care not to open duplicate issues.
